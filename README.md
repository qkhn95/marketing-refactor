Updating the marketing agency code to use HTML

#1 - Changed the webpage title to include company name, this allows visitors to know which tab is the marketing agency.

#2 - Changed code to allow "search engine optimization" button to work.

The original code was incorrect (below)

The above code was missing the class element, which stopped the "Search Engine Optimization" button from working. I have added this code which allows the button to now operate (fixed code below)

replace divs with semantic htmls
