# Updating Marketing Refactor Code

Below is a list of all the changes

### 1 - Changed the webpage title to include company name, this allows visitors to know which tab is the marketing agency.

### 2 - Changed code to allow "Search Engine Optimization" button to work.

The original code was incorrect (below)

The above code was missing the class element, which stopped the "Search Engine Optimization" button from working. I have added this code which allows the button to now operate (fixed code below)

### 3 - Adding ALT attributes to images

Looking through the code you can see there are no "alt" attributes to the images on the webpage. I have gone through each image and added an alt attribute. This can make it clear to users the purpose of the image.
